There are certain things that the software ought not to do to the hardware. While these 
things are not physically destructive on their own, they will cause the hardware to act 
unpredictabty strange, which may cause the user to be physically destructive. 
<P>
While we certainly could have protected the system from many of the following 
probfems, I doubt that we would have found them all. ln addition, the act of software 
doing one of these things means that there is a problem in the software anyway and 
the intended function would probably not happen. Additionally, this is only a loy. If this 
unit were a bio-medical device I would have found a safer solution. 
<P>
The things that software <U>MUST NOT</U> do and the precautions software
<U>MUST</U> take are either intuitive nor obvious, so I wilt detail them here. 
<P>

if you do any of the things that I tell you not to do, the hardware wiil act unpredictably 
and will not be expected to recover without a complete system initialization. So don't 
do them. 
<P>

<LI>Suzy SCB Register Accesses<BR>
All of the registers in the Suzy SCB are unsafe to touch while the sprite engine is in 
operation. This is true for BOTH read and write accesses. Prior to accessing any of 
those registers (they are identified in the hardware address appendix as 'unsafe') you 
must first check to see if the sprite engine is running (either for sprites or math). 
Those status bits are in SPRSYS. 
<P>
<LI>Sequential Memory Accesses<BR>
CPU instructions that result in a Suzy access followed immediately by another Suzy 
access will probably break Suzy. Please do not do them.
<P>
<LI>Compiler Stuff<BR>
Some compilers do stupid things when they convert complex statements. For 
example, "A = B = C = 0" may get converted to:
 store 0 to C,
 read C and write it to B,
 read B and write it to A. 
This will break if you try it on any of my hardware, so unless you are real sure that your 
compiler will never do it, don't write your code that way.
<P>
<LI>Writes to the Game Cartridge<BR>
Writes to Suzy are blind, but will complete before any other CPU function can disturb 
them EXCEPT in the case of writes to the game cart. For 12 ticks after a write to the 
game cart is started, the CPU MUST NOT access Suzy (read or write). If it does, ihe 
write to the cart will be trashed. 
<P>
<LI>Palettes and Page Breaks<BR>
This one is an actual hardware bug of mine. The hardware signal that ends the loading 
process for any SCB element comes 2 bytes prior to the actual end of the element. If 
a page break comes at the same time as the 'end' signal, then that end signal needs 
to be delayed by one cycle. If not, the loading process will end and not start up again at 
the end of the page break. Well, I screwed up the logic for the pen index palette loader. 
Therefore if a pen index palette starts at address xxFA, a page break will occur at the 
same time as the 'end' signal and this page break will be ignored by the palette loader. 
The last 2 bytes of this 8 byte palette will not be loaded from RAM, and the values 
foaded by the previous SCB will still be in the hardware. Pen index numbers C,D,E, 
and F will be incorrectly unchanged. Sometimes I am such a jerk.

There are also things that software people do that merely annoy the hardware people 
rather than annoy the end user. This includes seemingly harmtess activities like sub-
decoding bit vahes from byte descriptions (sprite types, for instance), or assuming 
address continuity between areas of hardware (bke SPRCTLO follows the Sprite 
Control Block). -
<BR>Please don't do them. 
<P>
It would be difficult to list all of the possibilities, so I will list the general considerations 
and ask you to be sensible about them. In addition, please feel free to submit a 
request for an exemption on a specific case. If it is granted, we will change the 
specification so as to make the special case forever legal. The price will be small. 
<P>
The list:
Do not decode any bits within any byte definitions.
Do not assume any address continuity between hardware sections.
Do not assume that any hardware addresses that are multiply mapped will remain so. 
Do not use un-defined bits within a byte for anything. 
<P>
If you notice an unspecified bvt clever interaction between two or more sections of 
hardware, please come and tell me about it. It is more likely that it is a mistake rather 
than an omission from the spec. 
<P>
I will try to list the approved exemptions in the spec. 
<P>
<B>Thank You</B>

Some of the hardware functions, as designed by us mindless brutes, require special 
handling. As we discover these requirements, I will list them here.
<P>

<LI>Timer Reload Disable<BR>
If a particular timer reload bit is set to disable, the timer ought to count down to zero, 
stop counting, and set its 'timer done' bit. However, if the 'timer done' bit was already 
set, the timer will not even do its tirst count. Therefore, when the setting of 'timer 
reload' is 'disabled', you must clear the 'timer done' bit in order for the timer to count at 
all.
<P>
This 'clear' can be accomplished by setting the 'reset timer done" bit, but that can 
cause a new and exciting problem. The 'clear' can also be accomplished by writing 
directly to the byte that contains the 'timer done' bit.
The answer of choice is to write a 0 to bit 3 of the control byte (TlMnCTLB). Since the 
other bits are adjusted by hardware, I recommend writing a full byte of 0 to that 
register when you need to do the 'clear' function. 
<P>
<LI>Reset Timer Done<BR>
The 'reset timer done' bit in the hardware registers was mistakenly designed as a 
'level' signal rather than a 'pulse' signal. Therefore, to use it correctly, you must 'pulse' 
it in software. This means first setting it high, and then setting it low. The problem with 
just leaving it high is that the dumb hardware may (depending on other conditions in 
that particular timer) send a continuous interrupt to the interrupt logic. In addition, since 
a lucky interrvpt might actually slip in during this 'software pulse', the recommended 
process is to clear the interrupt enable bit at the same time that the reset timer done 
bit is set. Happily, both bits are in the same register. Please remember to restore the 
'enable' bit as you release the 'reset' bit.
