	This chapter describes the steps required to create a Handy display, with the primary emphasis on 
	the system macros and support code that you should use. All aspects of creating a display are 
	covered, from initializing the display hardware and color palette to rendering sprites, double- 
	buffering, waiting for end-of-frame, and more. The chapter ends with a summary of all of the 
	system's display macros and a few examples of their usage.

<P>
	To create a normal Handy display using sprites, you most: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>set up the display timers to create the desired display update rate (also known as the 
		frame rate) 
<LI>write the address of your render buffer into the appropriate Suzy sprite registers 
<LI>if you want hardware collision, write the address of your collision buffer into the 
		appropriate Suzy sprite registers 
<LI>render your sprites 
<LI>display the buffer 
</UL>
<P>

	Another Handy display that you might be interested in making is the still-picture display. This is 
	the sort of display where you aren't interested in fancy double-buffering and all, you simply have a 
	picture to display or you want to render a picture and then display it. To display a still-picture you 
	must: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>set up the display timers to create any display update rate (the suggested rate for still 
		pictures is 60 frames per second) 
<LI>fill in your display buffer with display data of some sort, including using the sprite 
		engine if you're careful to take the necessary preliminary steps 
<LI>display your buffer 
</UL>
<P>
	The Handy display macros take care of all the details of the above steps for you, making the 
	creation and management of a Handy display an easy affair. This chapter describes these macros 
	- with respect to the hardware they affect - and explains how to use the macros. 
<P>
	The sprite rendering and display creation macros can be found in the files . 
	6502:macros/sprite.mac and 6502:macros/display.mac. Supporting source code can be found in 
	the files 6502:src/sprite.src and 6502:src/display.src. If you are going to use sprites you must 
	include both sprite.mac and sprite.src. If you are going to create displays you must include both 
	display.mac and display.src. 
<P><B>The MACROs in BLL do have other names !</B>
<P>
<A NAME = "_01"><U><LI>Initializing The Display Hardware And System Software</U></A> 
<P>
	To initialize the Handy display, you use the SETDISP macro or one of its big brothers 
	SETDISP_60, SETDISP_50, SETDISP_30, SETDlSP_25, SETDISP_20, SETDISP_15 and 
	SETDISP_10. These macros, known collectively as the set-display macros, do everything to 
	make a display except actually turn the display on (you do that later after everything is all set up; 
	see Turning The Display On And Off for details). 
<P>
	An essential step taken by the set-dispiay macros is to establish the display's frame rate, which is 
	the number of times per second that a new buffer will be displayed by the hardware. 
<P>
	If you want your display to have one of the 'standard' frame rates, you can use one of the macros 
	SETDISP_60, SETDISP_50, SETDISP_30, SETDISP_25, SETDISP_20, SETDISP_15 or 
	SETDISP_10. These macros set up the display for 60, 50, 30, 25, 20, 15 or 10 frames per 
	second respectively by invoking the SETDISP macro with appropriate arguments. 
 	If you want a frame rate that's not among the 'standard' frame rates, you can use the SETDISP 
	macro directly. The SETOISP macro requires 5 arguments: the reload value and control flags tor 
	both the vertical and horizontal display timers which are named HCOUNT and VCOUNT, and the 
	magic 'P' value for the PBKUP display register. This gets the display hardware running in such a 
	way that the correct amount of time is spent displaying each line of your buffer so that its beautiful 
	glow correctty reflects in the eye of the beholder. To understand what values should be used for 
	an invocation of SETDISP, refer to the Display section of the Handy Hardware Specification 
	manual for a discussion and formulae. 
<P>
	The SETDISP macro also initializes DISPCTL RAM, which is the RAM-based shadow mask of the 
	hardware's DISPCTL register. 
<P>
	If you are going to be using sprites then your initialization process should include a call to 
	INITSUZY, which must be done only once and must be done before the first use of the sprite 
	engine. 
<P>
	If you are going to be waiting for end-of-frame or end-of-line then your initialization process should 
	include a call to INITEOF and/or INITEOL, which must be done only once and must be done 
	before the first use of the wait macros. 
<P>
	You need to set up a color palette. See the section Setting We Display Colors for details. 
<P>
	If you're going to use hardware collision detection, you need to perform some initialization. See 
	the section Setting Up For Hardware Collisions for details. 
<P>
	If you're going to be double-buffering, you need to perform some initialization. See the section 
	Setting Up For Oouble-Buffering for details. 
<P><A NAME = "_02"><U><LI>Setting The Display Colors</U></A>
<P>
	The RGB16, RGB16_I and RGB_AXY macros set up the Handy color palette for you. RGB16 and 
	RGB16_I allow you to set up all 16 colors at once, while RGB_AXY lets you change the values of a 
	single color. 
<P>
	The set-color macros take effect immediately, so if you call them at any time other than during 
	horizontal or vertical retrace you may get display glitches. So, you may ask, how do you wait until 
	horizontal or vertical retrace? See the section Waiting For End Of Frame And End Of Line for 
	details. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_03"><U><LI>Setting The Display's Horizontal And Vertical Offsets</U></A>
<P>
	The HOFF8, VOFF8, HOFF16 and VOFF16 macros, known collectively as the set-offset macros, 
	set up the horizontal and vertical offsets of the Handy display window within the imaginary display 
	world. The values that you might choose to provide to these macros is discvssed in detail in the 
	POSITlONING OF THE HANDY OISPLAY AND SPRITES chapter of this manual. <BR>
	The set-offset macros take effect immediately. The very next time you render sprites the new 
	offsets will be used. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_04"><U><LI>Setting Up For Hardware Collisions</U></A> 
<P>
	If you're going to use hardware collision detection, you should use ihe macro SETCOLL, which 
	expects two arguments: the address of a collision buffer that's DISPLAY BUFSIZE big and 
	aligned on a 4-byte boundary, and the offset into your Sprite Control Blocks of the byte that will 
	act as your collision depository. Refer to the Handy Hardware Specification manual for complete 
	details about the meaning of these two values. 
<P>
	Note that the offset to the sprite's collision depository is a 16-bit signed value, which allows you to 
	specify a negative offset to your depository if you want your collision values to be written to 
	memory locations that precede your SCB's. This is a very reasonable thing to do if you have 
	SCB's that vary in size, which they do when you take advantage of the sprite engine's reuse-data 
	ability. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_05"><U><LI>Declaring A Display Buffer</U></A> 
<P>
	Handy hardware requires that your display buffers start on an address whose binary 
	representation ends with two bits of zero (any address which is an even multiple of 4) and must be 
	DISPLAY BUFSIZE (currently 8,160, or $1FE0) bytes long. You can force your buffer to be 
	aligned on an address that's a multiple of 4 by using the assembler's .ALIGN directive, like this: 
<PRE>
		SETDBUF Buffer1, Buffer2 
		...
		. ALIGN 4 
		Buffer1 .DS DISPLAY_BUFSIZE 
		.ALIGN 4 
		Buffer2 .DS DISPLAY_BUFSIZE 
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME = "_06"><U><LI>Rendering Sprites</U></A> 
<P>
	Before the first time you render sprites, you must invoke the INITSUZY macro. You should do this 
	oniy once, during the initialization sequence of your program. 
<P>
	The SPRITES macro renders your list of sprites into the off-display buffer pointed to by the 
	variable RenderButfer. The double-butfer logic initializes RenderBuffer for you. If you are not 
	double-buffering, you need to set RenderBuffer to the address of your buffer. 
<P>
	The SPRITES macro doesn't automatically cause the render buffer to be displayed, but instead 
	allows you to call SPRITES multiple times with ditferent sprite lists before making the final display 
	visibie to the user. After you're done rendering all of your sprites, to make the RenderBuffer the 
	on-display buffer use DBUF DISPLAY if you are double-buffering or DISPLAY if you're not. 
<P>
 	SPRITES calls WAITSUZY for you while the sprite engine is running, which serves dual purposes: 	0 
	it puts the CPU to sleep which allows the sprite engine to run; it returns control to you only after 
	the sprite engine is finished, atter which it's safe for you to do any Suzy stuff like using the math 
	hardware or starting up the sprite engine again. Note that becavse SPRITES calls WAITSUZY you 
	should notcall WAITSUZY after calling SPRITES, else the system will hang forever. 
<P>
	You don't need to be double-buffering to use the SPRlTES macro. However, if you aren't 
	double-buffering you'll need to set the Render8uffer variable to the address of your display buffer 
	before using the SPRITES macro. Note that the value you store in RenderBuffer should be the 
	top-left byte of your display, without regard to the state of FLIP. 
<P>
	The INITSUZY and SPRITES macros set up the sprite engine hardware in all the required ways, 
	thereby simplifying your usage of the sprite engine. All of the steps performed by these macros 
	are detailed in the Sprite Engine Initialization section of the Handy Specification document. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_07"><U><LI>About Double-Buffering</U></A> 
<P>
	Usually, game designers will want to use two buffers for creating their displays. The buffers are 
	alternately used as the display buffer and the render buffer. At any given instant, the display 
	buffer is being displayed to the user while the render buffer is available for sprite rendering. The 
	address of the render bufter can usually be found in a system-maintained variable named 
	RenderBuffer, which will be described presently. When the programmer has finished rendered a 
	new display into the render buffer, the render and display buffer roles are swapped. This 
	technique of maintaining two buffers and swapping them as appropriate is known as double- 
	buffering. 
<P>
	The Handy system software provides you with a collection of macros that make it easy to create a 
	double-buffered display. All you need to do is: 
<P>
<UL>
		<LI>define the addresses of your buffers using the SETDBUF macro 
		<LI>render your sprites using SPRITES 
		<LI>display your new buffer using DBUF_DISPLAY 
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME = "_08"><U><LI>Setting Up For Double-Buffering</U></A>
<P>
	You use the SETDBUF macro to define your display buffers and to set the system up for double- 
	buffering. SETDBUF expects two arguments: the addresses of your two video buffers. One of 
	the buffers will be set up as the render butfer, which you can begin rendering into. This buffer 
	then will be displayed when you first call DBUF_DISPLAY. 
<P>
	The rules for declaring display buffers are discussed in the section Declaring A Display Buffer 
	above. 
<P>
	You provide the SETDBUF macro with the addresses of your buffers as they are defined when 
	FLIP mode is not selected. If you want to flip the display, you do so after calling SETDBUF by 
	using the FLIP macro (defined below).
<P>
 	Any time after invoking SETDBUF you can detect which buffer the system believes to be the 
	render butfer by examining the sys1em variable RenderBuffer, which is initialized within SETDBUF 
	and thereafter managed by the system. At all times this variable will point to the first byte of the 
	buffer that's currently the off-display butfer. However, note that it's not atways safe to render into 
	the RenderBuffer without first using the WAITEOF function. See the sections Rendering Sprites 
	and Waiting For End Of Frame And End Of Line for a description and discussion of these macros. 
<P>
	If you won't be using double-buffering to create your display - brave, aren't you - you don't need 
	to use the SETDBUF macro. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_09"><U><LI>The Double-Buffer Display Dance</U></A> 
<P>
	When double-buffering, first you define your buffers using SETDBUF, then you render your 
	sprites into the render buffer using SPRITES, and finally you invoke the DBUF DISPLAY macro 
	to swap the display and render macros. Easy, eh? 
<P>
	Unfortunately, there's a catch: after control returns from DBUF DISPLAY the RenderBuffer will 
	contain the address of the buffer that's still be being displayed by the hardware. If you begin to 
	render in the buffer before waiting for the start of the next frame, then you will probably overwrite 
	the current display betore the hardware is finished displaying it. The result: unsightly display 
	dandruff. Instead, you'll need to wait until the hardware is finished displaying the current on- 
	display buffer before you can start rendering into it as the new off-display butfer. This can be 
	accomplished by using the WAITEOF (wait for end-of-frame) macro with a sequence of events 
	something like this: 
<P>
<UL>
		<LI>Start the sprite engine using SPRITES, which returns control to you after the sprites 
		have been rendered 
		<LI> Use DBUF DISPLAY to set up the hardware to show your newly rendered display 
		buffer at the start of the next frame 
		<LI> React to player input, perform enemy intelligence and do other game logic 
		<LI> Set up your sprites for the next display trame 
		<LI> Use WAITEOF to wait until the last line of the current display has been processed 
		<LI> Restart at the top of this loop 
</UL>
<P>
	The above technique requires that you are sure that your game logic will be completed before 
	EOF is reached. If your code runs too long one frame and you miss EOF, you end up waiting all 
	the way to the end of the next frame. An alternate way to wait until the hardware .s finished 
	displaying the current on-display buffer can be achieved by using the WAITNEOF (wait no-clear 
	for end-of-frame) macro with a sequence of events something like this: 
<P>
<UL>
		<LI> Start the sprite engine using SPRITES, which returns control to you after the sprites 
		have been rendered 
		<LI> Use DBUF DlSPLAY to set up the hardware to show your newly rendered display 
		buffer at the start of the next frame 
		<LI> Stash the processor status byte, set interrupt disable, clear the DISPLAY EOFFLAG 
		in the DisplayFlags variable, restore the processor status byte 
		<LI> React to player input, perform enemy intelligence and do other game logic 
		<LI> Set up your sprites for the next display frame 
 		<LI> Use WAITNEOF (which doesn't clear the OISPLAY EOFFLAG) to wait until the last line 	0 
		of the current display has been processed, (it may already have been processed) 
		<LI> Restart at the top of this kep 
</UL>
<P>
	However, everything costs. The problem with these alternate techniques is that it allows you to 
	get 'way behind EOF. 
<P>
	The WAITEOF and WAITNEOF mactos and the DISPLAY_EOFFLAG are described in the section 
	Waiting For End of Frame and End of Line below. 
<P>
	After the DBUF_DISPLAY macro has done its specific double-buffering work, the address of the 
	new display buffer is written to the hardware display registers by the system's end-of-trame 
	handler. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_0a"><U><LI>Presenting A Still Picture</U></A> 
<P>
	Your program may want to present a still picture to the user. For instance, you may want to present 
	a series of full-trame pictures to the user. Also, in a normal game environment, before your first 
	sprite display you may want to display a startup screen. This section describes the technique for 
	displaying a still picture. 
<P>
	If you are double-buffering using the system's macros and you want to render a picture into the 
	off-display buffer, the RenderSuffer variable will contain the address of the buffer you should use. 
	After you render into the buffer, display it as usual using the DBUF DISPLAY macro. 
<P>
	If you have a single buffer that you want to display, use the DISPBUF macro. DISPBUF expects 	0 
	one argument: the address of your buffer. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_0b"><U><LI>Displaying A Buffer</U></A> 
<P>
	To tell the hardware that you want the render buffer to be the next display buffer, use the 
	DISPLAY macro. 
<P>
	The DISPLAY macro writes the RenderBuffer value DISPADRL,H registers after translating the 
	value if the FLIP bits are set. After the hardware has finished displaying the current frame, it will 
	use your new buffer pointer when setting up to display the next frame. 
<P>
	Under normal system operation the DISPLAY macro is invoked by the system's end-of-frame 
	handler. You shouldn't need to use DISPLAY yourself. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_0c"><U><LI>Turning The Display On And Off</U></A> 
<P>
	After you've initialized the hardware. set your color palette, created a display buffer, filled it up with 
	gorgeous imagery and told the hardware where to find it, finally you can tum on the display 
	hardware. Aah. 
<P>
	The display is tumed on using the cleverly-named DISPLAY_ON macro. Let's see, what might we 
	call the macro to tum the display off? How about DISPLAY_NOT_ON? Nah, the macro to turn off 
	the display is called DISPLAY_OFF. 
<P>
	These macros work by reading the value from DISPCTL_RAM which is a RAM shadow copy of the 
	DISPCTL hardware register, then setting or clearing the display-on bit and saving the resultant 
	value to both DISPCTL and DISPCTL_RAM. 
<P>
	You can call DISPLAY_ON and DISPLAY_OFF any time you want, as often as you want. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_0d"><U><LI>Flipping The Display (And The Joystick)</U></A>
<P>
	To flip the Handy display 180&deg all you have to do is use the FLIP macro, which sets everything up 
	to flip the display and sets the joystick control bit to flip the meaning of the joystick positions. This 
	means that to flip the display, all you do is call FLIP and everything else works exactly the same, 
	which makes flipping the display a complete no-brainer. 
<P>
	Note that regardless of the state of FLIP the RenderBuffer variable will contain the address of the 
	top-left byte of the off-display buffer. 
<P>
	FLIP sets the DISPCTL register and DISPCTL_RAM variable when you call the macro. In the 
	current implementation of the hardware, this could cause the display to flip immediately, even if 
	the display is halfway rendered, which could cause the display to be mixed for part of a frame. If 
	you want to avoid this effect, you should make sure that you call FLIP only immediately after 
	WAITEOF. On the other hand, the effect is brief and therefore probably not worth mangling your 
	logic too much. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_0e"><U><LI>Waiting For End Of Frame And End Of Line</U></A>
<P>
	Many times you will want to do something that you shouldn't do until after the video is finished 
	processing the last line of the display (or the last pixel of the current line). For instance, you might 
	want to change the color palette at a time that is guaranteed to not glitch the display, or you may 
	have finished everything you need to do for the current display and you want to wait until you're 
	sure that the display buffers have been swapped before you start creating the next display. 
<P>
	The instant of time when the Handy hardware has just finished displaying the lines of the current 
	buffer is known as end of frame (or EOF). When the hardware starts displaying the next buffer, 
	this is known as top of frame. The interval between the end and 1op of frame is known as vertical 
	retrace, which on video displays is the time required to reposition the electron beam to the top of 
	the video tube. Handy has no need for a vertical retrace, but a pseudo vertical retrace interval is 
	created anyway to allow programmers to make vertical retrace sorts of changes to the system. 
 	The same is true horizontally, there is an inetara ol time known as the end of line (or EOL). and 
	the hardware is set up to create a pseudo horizontal retrace time interval. 
<P>
	If you are going to use the EOF macros, you must define the constant EOF_USER. If you are 
	going to use the EOL macros. you must define the constant EOL USER. If you don't define 
	these constants, the associated macros won't be defined and and supporting source code won't 
	be included. 
<p>
	Before you use the WAITEOF and/or WAITEOL macros you must use INITEOF and/or INITEOL. 
	You shouldl invoke these macros only once, presumably during the initialization code of your 
	program. 
<P>
	To wait for the end of frame, you use the WAITEOF macro. To wait for the end of a display line, 
	you use the WAITEOL macro. These macros clear the system's DisplayFlags variable's 
	DISPLAY_EOFFLAG and DISPLAY_EOLFLAG respectively, and then hold the CPU in a loop 
	until the end-of-frame or end-of-line event takes place (which is detected by the fact that the 
	system's EOF handler sets the DISPLAY_EOFFLAG and the EOL handter sets the 
	DISPLAY_EOLFLAG). 
<P>
	WAITEOF (and WAITEOL) presume that the event of interest has not yet occurred at the time the 
	macro is entered. This can cause problems: if your code gets behind in a given frame and 
	reaches WAITEOF just after EOF, then WAITEOF would have you wait an entire frame, which is 
	probably at odds with your designs. Fortunately, there is a way to either wait for EOF if it hasn't 
	happened yet or proceed immediately if it has already occurred. This is accomplished by clearing 
	the DISPLAY_EOFFLAG early in your logic and then using the WAITNEOF macro at the end of 
	your logic. WAITNEOF is identical to WAITEOF except that the DISPLAY_EOFFLAG isn't cleared 
	before the wait loop is entered. Therefore, if the EOF handler has atready gotten in there and set 
	the DISPLAY_EOFFLAG by time your code reaches WAITNEOF, your code will detect this and
	exit the wait loop without delay. The problem with this technique is that if your code gets way 
	behind the display you can end up with severe wrap-around if you're not careful. 
<P>
	The WAITNEOL macro is analogous horizontally to WAITNEOF. 
<P>
<A NAME = "_0f"><U><LI>Summary Of Display Creation Macros</U></A>
<P>
	Following is an alphabetic listing and summary of all the display creation macros. For the most up- 
	to-date list of the arguments required by these macros, refer to the 6502:macros/display.mac and 
	6502:macros/sprite.mac files. 
<UL>
	  <lI>DBUF_DISPLAY<BR> 
	After you've set everything up for double-buffering and you've rendered into the off-display
	buffer, this macro causes the render butfer to be the one displayed during the next display frame 

	 <LI>DISPBUF <BR>
	This macro causes the buffer specified by the argument to be the one displayed 
	during the next disptay frame. Doesn't perform any double-buffering functions 

	<LI>DISPLAY <BR>
	This macro is used by the display system, during the EOF interrupi code. The 
	programmer shouldn't have any need for this macro. To display a single buffer, refer to 
	the DISPBUF macro 

	<LI>DISPLAY ON and DISPLAY OFF <BR>
	These macros tum the display hardware on and off respectively 

	<LI>FLIP <BR>
	When the user wants the display flipped 180&deg, this macro does all the work for you 

	<LI>HOFF8 and VOFFS, HOFF16 and VOFF16 <BR>
	These macros are used to position the display window within the display world. The 
	values take effect the next time you render sprites 

	<LI>INITEOF and INITEOL<BR> 
	If you are going to use the WAITEOF and/or WAITEOL functions, you must first invoke 
	the associated INITEOF and/or INITEOL macro. These macros should be called only once. 

	<LI>INITSUZY <BR>
 	This macro must be called only once, betore you first use Suzy's sprite engine or math 
 	hardware 

	<LI>RGB16, RGB16_l and RGB_AXY<BR> 
	These macros provide several different ways to write values to the hardware color 
	palette registers 

	<LI>SETCOLL <BR>
	If you are going to be using hardware collision detection, you must use this macro to 
	set up the collision buffer and to define the offset to your SCB collision depository 

	<LI>SETDBUF <BR>
	You use this macro to set up for double-buffered display creation, including specifying 
	the addresses of your buffers 

	<LI>SETDISP <BR>

	The Handy display map and sprite positioning is designed to be both convenient to use if you 
	want to do simple sprite positioning and powerful to use if you want to let the hardware do its 
	several flavors of clipping for you. To understand how it works, you have to know about the Handy 
	display wortd and the Handy display window. 
<P>
<CENTER><H5><U>Handy Display Universe</U></H5>
<P><IMG SRC = "disp01.gif" ALT = "[Lynx Display within a 512x512 world]">
</CENTER>
<P><A NAME = "_14">
<LI>Handy Imaginary Display World </A>
<P>

	The Handy display world is an imaginary area that's 512 pixels across by 512 lines tall. You 
	position your sprites relative to the top-lett comer of the display world, and you position your 
	Handy display window somewhere within the display world. As you will come to understand, the 
	display worid doesn't really exist other than as a concept and a numeric base used by the sprite 
	hardware. 
<P><A NAME = "_15">
<LI>Handy Display Window</A> 
<P>
	The Handy display window is the actual RAM display buffer which is written to by the sprite 
	hardware and read from by the display hardware. The RAM consists of 160 pixels by 102 lines, 
	which in 4-bit display mode is 80 bytes x 102 8160 bytes total for the display, and in 2-bit display 
	mode is 40 bytes x 102 lines 4080 bytes total. 
<P>
	The display window is positioned somewhere within the display world. You specify the display 
	window position by setting the hardware's HOFF and VOFF registers, which describe respectively 
	the horizontal and vertical offsets of the top-left corner of the display window with respect to the 
	top-left corner of the display world. Some program designs wilf call for setting these once and 
	leaving them constant; other designs might incorporate changing these values to create scrolling 
	effects. 
<P>
	The positioning of the display window within the world is just an imaginary thing; the display 
	window is RAM, but the rest of the display world is just numbers used by ihe hardware to effect 
	efficient clipping logic. 
<P>
	When you ask for your sprites to be rendered, only the sprites that appear within display window 
	wilf actually be rendered. 
<P><A NAME = "_16">
<LI>Sprite Positioning In The World And The Window </A>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="disp02.gif" ALT = "[One Sprite Drawn 19 times]"></CENTER>
<P>
	Sprites are defined relative to the top-left corner of the display world. When a sprite's reference 
	point is the coordinate (0,0) then the sprite is located in the top-left corner of the world. A 
	coordinate of (511,511) locates a sprite at the bottom-right corner of the world. In order to be able 
	to position sprites anywhere from 0 to 511, we need 9 bits for both vertical and horizontal 0 
	positioning. In tact, there are 16 bits for positioning on each axis, with the upper 7 bits currently 
	ignored by the system though they should be initialized appropriately as described
	under 16-Bit Positioning below. 
<P>
	Let's look at a positioning example. Imagine that we have the X sprite shown in the above 
	illustration, which sprite is 32 pixels wide and tall, and we want to define 16 of these along a 
	diagonal. We define the sprite locations relative to the top-left of the display world, putting the first 
	sprite at (0,0). the second at (32,32), and so on. Note that so far we're just talking about 
	positioning the sprites, not displaying them. How the sprites are actually disptayed depends on 
	the position of your display window. 
<P>
 
<CENTER><H5><U>Display Window Positioned Within Display World</U></H5>
<IMG SRC="disp03.gif"></CENTER>
<p>
 
	To display some of the sprites we've defined, we position the display window somewhere in the 
	display world. The positioning of the display window within the display world is independent of 
	the positioning of our sprites within the display world. In the above illustration, the window is 
	located with a horizontal offset of 96 and a vertical offset of 160 from the top-left of the display 
	world. The window covers the display world coordinates from (96,160) to (255,261). Four of our 
	sprites appear in the display window, the ones with the coordinates (128,128), (160,160). 
	(192,192) and (224,224). When we ask to have our sprites rendered, those 4 sprites will be 
	drawn into the display window RAM while the other 12 will be clipped by the hardware and not 
	drawn at all. 
<P>
	Notice that some of our sprites are partly on-window and partly off-window. The off-window 
	imagery of these sprites is automatically clipped by the hardware and not rendered. "Whew!" sigh 
	the programmers who know how much work they just got out of. This means that you can make 
	sprites slide off-window just by positioning them and letting the hardware do the work. The 
	hardware does even fancier clipping, which is described below in the section Hardware Sprite 
	Imagery Clipping Techniques. 
<P>
	There are two techniques you can use for positioning a sprite, which techniques can be 
	intermixed in the same display without restriction. The techniques are described in the two 
	following sections, and include: 
<P>
<UL>
		<LI> Simple 8-bit positioning of sprites, which provides a reasonable amount of clipping 
		around the edges of the display window .
		<LI> Full 16-bit (9 significant bits) positioning of sprites, which carries the cost of doing two- 
		byte math and move operations rather than one-byte when positioning sprites but 
		which gives the ability to move very large objects off-window.
</UL>
<P>
	By the way, if you define an entire display world full of sprites, you could show all the sprites simply 
	by panning the display window around within the world. None of the sprite definitions would need 
	to be changed to do this. You need only change HOFF and VOFF to move the window. 
<P><A NAME = "_17">
<LI>8-Bit Positioning </A>
<p>
	Handy sprites have 9 significant bits horizontally and vertically for positioning, which is great, but 
	we recognize that programmers would rather work with 8-bit rather than 16-bit quantities 
	whenever possible, especially with something done as often as setting the positions of sprites. 
	Fortunately, the Handy display window technique makes it very easy to position sprites with 
	reasonably good off-window clipping using just 8 bits for positioning. Consider the following 
	illustration. 
<P>
<CENTER><H5><U>General Purpose Display Window Positioning For 8 Bit Coordinates</U></H5>
<IMG SRC="disp04.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
	The above illustration shows one of the niftiest capabilities of the display window scheme. Notice 
	that the display window is centered in the 8-bit neighborhood of the display wortd. When you set 
	up your window in this way, you can position your sprites using only 8 bits of position and still get 
	a good amount of hardware clipping around the edges of the window. Sprites as much as 48 
	pixels wide and 77 lines tall in any direction from the sprite's reference point can be positioned 
	completely off-window (except for the very last pixel; when that one goes, get rid of the sprite!). 
	Sprites that you want to move off-window and that are centered about the reference point can be 
	as wide as 96 pixels and as tall as 154 lines tall. This is the most general purpose positioning of 
	the display window within the display world when using 8-bit coordinates, and, unless you have 
	some extraordinary needs for your sprites, this is probably the display window configuration you'll 
	use. 
<P>
	On the other hand, if you have sprites that need to have dimensions that are wider than 48 pixels 
	from the reference point or taller than 77 from the reference point, you might choose to position 
	the display window other than as shown above. For instance, if all sprites that must move off- 
	window left or right are defined with the reference point along the left edge of the imagery, and 
	you set the display window to its rightmost position in the 8-bit neighborhood, then the sprites 
	could be as wide as 96 pixels wide and still be clipped lett and right. The following illustration 
	shows the desired position of the display window when you have sprites that are all centered 
	about the reference point vertically and ihat all have ihe horizontal reference point at the left edge 
	of the imagery. 
<p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="disp05.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
	Note that with either technique, in fact with any of the ways you might try to position the display 
	window in 8-bit coordinate mode, you are restricted to a maximum sprite width of 96 pixels and 
	height of 154 pixels if you want to be able to slide the sprite off-window. And the widest margin 
	defines the greatest width you can have from reference point to edge, whi1e the thinnest margitl 
	defines the maximum width you can have from the reference point to the other edge. For 
	example, if you use an HOFF of 10, there will be 10 pixels of margin on the left and 86 pixels on 
	the right, which means that your sprites could be up to 86 pixels from reference point to left edge 
	of the imagery but at most 10 pixels from reference point to the right edge. All of this goes for 
	height too. Confusing enough for you? If so, then stop reading and get back to work! 
<p>
	Remember that though you may be using only 8 of the 16 position bits of each axis, neverthe! ess 
	all 16 bits are still used by the hardware so you must initialize the upper 8 bits to zero. 
<p><A NAME = "_18">
<LI>16-Bit Positioning </A>
<P>
	If you are going to use all 9 significant bits when positioning your sprites, you should, for the sake 
	of upward compatibility with future versions of the hardware, make sure that you write complete 
	16-bit values to the position fields of your sprite control block. 
<p>
	If you want to give your sprite a negative coordinate then you should set all the high biis of the 
	high byte of the position register. On the other hand, if it's your intention to position your sprite at 
 	a large positive coordinate (large being greater than 255) you currently can go as high as 511, 
	which is the limit of the current hardware. and which includes setting the 10th bit of the upper 
	position byte. To specify that you want a large positive number, you must clear the all the other 
	bits of the high position byte. Today the distinction doesn't matter, but with tomorrow's new 10-bit 
	position hardware you'll be glad you followed these rules because - surprise ! - your software still 
	works, although of course it will probably break for some other thing that the hardware guys forgot 
	to tell us about, the jerks .
<P>
	Note that it would be ultra-naughty to use the unused position bits for some purpose of your own. 
	This includes you, Peter. Don't goof around ! Remember, Uncle Oaddy is watching. 
<P><A NAME = "_19">
<LI>Hardware Sprite Imagery Clipping Techniques </A>
<P>
	When a sprite is being drawn, Handy hardware provides two levels of hardware clipping. The 
	clipping effects programmers are allowed to enjoy include: 
<P>
<UL>
		<LI> regular clipping where a sprite's reference point is on-window but the rendering of the 
		sprite leads to pixels being drawn off-window 
		super-clipping where a spri1e's reference point starts out off-window, which allows the 
		hardware to skip pixel processing of the majority of the sprite's imagery  	
	Before describing clipping, here's a quick refresher on how sprite data is laid out: 
		<LI> Imagery data is laid out in the four quadrants around the sprite's reference point The 
		sprite control block has bits that describe the starting quadrant of the data, and the data 
		itself contains code for switching to the next quadrant. 
		<LI> The sprite control block points to the first quadrant's first ‘line’ of sprite data.
		<LI> A line of sprite data starts with a byte that's either: a zero to specify end of data; a one to 
		specify end of quadrant (hardware advances to the next quadrant counter-clockwise); 
		or some other value which specifies the byte offset to the start of the next line of data. 
</UL>
<P>
	Regular clipping is easy to understand. When a given line of a sprite is being rendered, as soon 
	as one of the pixels falls off-window the hardware stops processing the line and skips ahead to the 
	start of the next line. As soon as one of the lines is going to be rendered off-window, the 
	hardware skips ahead through the rest of the lines looking for the next start of a quadrant (or end 
	of data, of course). 
<P>
	But wait, there's more. Introducing super-clipping, complete with overty elaborate illustrations. 
<P>
<CENTER><H5><U>Super-Clipping</U></H5><H5>"If you're not in the window you're
better than halfway home"</H5>
<IMG SRC="disp06.gif"></CENTER>
<P>

	If the sprite's reference point falls outside the display window, the sprite engine hardware does 
	super-clipping. Here's how it works: 
<P>
<UL>
		<LI> Imagine a line halfway around the display world from the center of the display window. 
		Call this the halfway line. 
		<LI> With each quadrant being rendered, a test is made at the start of each scan line to be 
		rendered with respect to the hatfway line on each axis. 
		<LI> If the direction of drawing in that quadrant is toward the halfway line on either axis, 
		which is to say away from the display window on that axis, then the imagery couldn't 
		possibly appear in the display window so the scan lines are not processed and instead 
		are used only to find the start of the next quadrant. This is superclipping. 
		<LI> Consider the CIRCLE sprite in the above illustration. From the sprite's reference point, 
		left and up are toward the display window (these axes are marked with Y for Yes) and 
		right and down are away from the display window (marked N for No). When either axis 
		votes No, the quadrant is super-clipped. This means that only the double-Yes 
		quadrant's pixel data will be processed, which means further that when a sprite's 
		reference point is off-window three of its four quadrants will be super-clipped! 
		<LI> If a quadrant is super-clipped, the sprite machine doesn't read any of the pixel data and 
		instead skips along madly a scan line at a time to the next quadrant to be processed. 
		The net effect is a great time savings. 
</UL>
<P>
	Super-clipping takes place in an environment that's centered around the display window, so to 
	make super-clipping clear our display world-window model used throughout this document needs 
	to be rendered differently, more egotistically. Consider the RECTANGLE sprite in the above 
	llustration. Logic might dictate that the upper-left quadrant of the sprite should be the only one 
	of super-clipped, as it seems that that's the only quadrant pointed toward the display window. 
	But in fact the lower-left quadrant is the only one not super-clipped. The reason why is best 
	illuminated by the following alternative view of the Handy universe. 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="disp07.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
	Note that in this scheme, sprites with negative coordinates may still be rendered in the display 
	window. Whether or not 9-bit sprites will be rendered correctly still needs to be worked out. 
	Suffice it to say for now that things will work correctly unless of course they don't.
