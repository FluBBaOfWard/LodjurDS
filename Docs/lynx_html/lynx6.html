This system has a 'sprite' engine that paints pixel information into a bit mapped 
screen. While the hardware does not actually manipulate individual sprites, the 
software 'sees' the hardware as a sprite system. The software may also directly read 
or write the bit mapped screen. While sprites are being painted, each pixel can be 
checked for collision with a previously painted sprite.

<U><LI>General Sprite Features</U><BR>
</A></A>
In addition to the normal teatures that accompany sprites, two major features are 
present in this system. One is that all sprites are sized in real time by the hardware 
prior to being painted to the screen. The other is that the data used to represent a 
sprite image is stored in RAM in a compacted format.
<P>
 Feature List:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Sprites have unlimited vertical size.<BR>
<LI>A sprites horizontal size is limited by a maximum of 254 bytes of source data. This 
is approximately 508 pixels unscaled.<BR>
<LI>Sprites have 1, 2, 3, or 4 bits per pixel of 'pen index number'. Pen index is 
converted to pen number by the contents of a 16 nybble (8 byte) pen index palette 
specific to each sprite.<BR>
<LI>The horizontal and vertical reference point of a sprite can be defined to be any pixel 
within that sprite at the time the programmer performs the compaction of the original 
image. The starting quadrant must also be specified at that time. The reference point 
is not dynamically changeable at run time, but the starting quadrant is. Note that there 
wiil be a positional alteration if the starting quadrant is changed. The sprite image is 
then painted in each of the 4 quadrants from that reference point. This allows sized 
sprites to be referenced to their related objects (trees to the ground, doors to walls, 
etc.).<BR>
<LI>The processing of an actual sprite can be 'skipped' on a sprite by sprite
 basis.<BR>
<LI>Sprites or portions of sprites that are positioned off-screen will be clipped by the 
hardware during the painting process.<BR>
<LI>Sprites can be horizontally and/or vertically flipped. The pivot point is the sprite's 
reference point.<BR>
<LI>Sprites are sized as they are painted. They can be reduced or enlarged. Horizontal 
and vertical sizing rates are independent.<BR>
<LI>Sprite source data is unpacked as the sprite is painted. For the purpose of allowing 
for simple modification of sprite data (text, scores, etc.) the packing/unpacking 
algorithm allows for literal images
The literal definition does not affect sizing.<BR>
<LI>As a sprite is painted, the collision buffer (topographically identical to the display 
buffer) is checked for the existence of a previously painted sprite. If one exists, a 
collision has occurred. This collision information is saved by the hardware for later 
interrogation by the software. Several specific functions are performed by the 
hardware on the collision data so as to make it usable by the software. They are 
described elsewhere. The software may elect to not have a collision buffer and thus 
have an additional BK bytes of RAM for the game. Sprites may be individually defined 
as non-colliding and thvs reduce painting time.<BR>
<LI>The horizontal size of a sprite can be modified every time a scan line is 
processed. This allows for 'stretching' a sprite and in conjunction with 'tilt' can be 
useful in creating arbitrary polygons. 
<LI>The horizontal position of a sprite can be modified every time a scan line is 
processed. This allows for 'tilting' a sprite and in conjunction with 'stretch' can be 
useful in creating arbitrary polygons.
<LI>The vertical size of a sprite can be modified every time a scan line is processed. 
This allows for 'stretching' a sprite vertically. The vertical stretch factor is the same as 
the horizontal stretch factor. Vertical stretching can be enab1ed on a sprite by sprite 
basis.

</A></A>
<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Pen Number Functions<BR>
 The pen numbers range from '0' to 'F. Pen numbers '1' thru 'D' are always collideable 
and opaque. They are the 13 generally usable pens for ordinary imagery. There are 8 
types of sprites, each has different characteristics relating to some or all of their pen 
numbers. 
<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Normal Sprites<BR>
A sprite may be set to 'normal'. This means that pen number '0' will be transparent 
and non-collideable. All other pens will be opaque and collideable. This is the sprite 
that is used for most 'action' images, weapons, enemies, obstacles, etc. 
<P><LI>Boundary Sprites <BR>
A sprite may be set to 'boundary'. This is a 'normal' sprite with the exception that pen 
number 'P is transparent (and still collideable). This allows for a 'boundary' at which a 
collision can occur without actual penetration (as in a ball bouncing off of a wall). 
<P><LI>Shadow Sprites <BR>
A sprite may be set to 'shadow'. This is a 'normal' sprite with the exception that pen 
number 'E' is non-collideable (but still opaque). This atlows for a non-colliding shadow 
on a sprite that is collideable (as in the shadow of a tree). 
<P><LI>Boundary-Shadow Sprites <BR>
This sprite is a 'normal' sprite with the characteristics of both 'boundary' and 'shadow'. 
That is, pen number 'P is transparent (and still collideable) and pen number 'E' is non-
collideable (but still opaque). 
<P><LI>Background-Shadow Sprites <BR>
A sprite may be set to 'background'. This sprite wiII overwrite the contents of the video 
and collision buffers. Pens '0' and 'F' are no longer transparent. This sprite is used to 
initialize the buffers at the start of a 'painting'. Since the buffers are not read before 
being written to, the painting process for this sprite will take approximately 1/4 less 
time. Additionally, no collision detection is done, and no write to the collision depository 
occurs.
There is no automatic clear of the video or collision buffers. If initialization is required, 
then it should be done using 'background' sprites. Note that partially used bytes (only 
one pixel) at either end of the line of pixels will do a read-modify-write cycle for that 
byte. The un-used pixel will remain unchanged. 
<P>
<B>BIG NOTE!!!</B><BR>
 The 'E' error will cause the pen number 'E' to be non-collideable and therefore not 
clear the collision buffer. If you use a background sprite to clear the collision buffer, be 
aware that 'E' will not clear its respective pixel. 
<P><LI>Background Non-Colliding Sprites <BR>
This is a 'background' sprite with the exception that no activity occurs in the collision 
buffer. This sprite will require 1/3 less time to paint than a normal background sprite. 
<P><LI>Non-Collideable Sprites <BR>
A sprite may be set 1o 'non-collideable'. This means that it will have no affect on the 
contents of the collision buffer and all other collision activities are overridden (pen 'F' is 
not coIlideable). Since the collision buffer is not touched, the painting process for this 
sprite will take approximately 1/4 less time. This sprite can be used for 'non-action' 
images such as clouds, cockpits, scoreboards, etc. 
<P><LI> Exclusive-Or Sprites <BR>
This is a 'normal' sprite with the exception that the data from the video buffer is 
exclusive-ored with the sprite data and written back out to the video buffer. Collision 
activity is 'normal'. Since a read-modify-write cycle is required for each video byte, this 
sprite could take up to 1/4 longer to paint than a 'normal' sprite. 
<P>
<B>BIG NOTE!!!</B><BR>
 The 'E' error will cause the pen number 'E' to be non-collideable and therefore not 
react with the collision buffer. If you use an exclusive or sprite, be aware that 'E' will 
not collide with its respective pixel. 
<P><LI>Hardware details of Sprite Types <BR>
The sprite types relate to specific hardware functions according to the following table: 
<PRE>
 Shadow-------------------------------|
 Boundary-Shadow--------------------| |
 Normal---------------------------| | |
 Boundary-----------------------| | | |
 Background-Shadow------------| | | | |
 Background-No Collision----| | | | | |
 Non-Collideable----------| | | | | | |
 Exclusive-or-Shadow----| | | | | | | |
                        | | | | | | | |
                        1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1   F is opaque 
                        0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0   E is collideable 
                        0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0   0 is opaque and collideable 
                        1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1   allow collision detect 
                        1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1   allow coll. buffer access 
                        1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   exclusive-or the data 
</PRE>
<P><I>
Shadow Error<BR>
The hardware is missing an inverter in the 'shadow' generator. This causes sprite 
types that did not invoke shadow to now invoke it and vice versa. The only actual 
functionaiity loss is that 'exclusive or' sprites and 'background' sprites will have 
shadow enabled. The above table shows the NEW truth. 
</I>
</OL>
<P><LI>Byte Boundary Conditions<BR> 
Bytes will contain more than one pixel, some of those pixels may be transparent, 
some sprites may be non-aligned background types, and some pen numbers may be 
transparent. Rather than explain how to handle all of the variations of those conditions, 
I decided to make the hardware handle it automatically. Therefore, when using the 
sprite engine to paint to the screen, there are no special conditions relating to screen 
byte boundaries. 
<P><LI>Horizontal Stretch<BR> 
The horizontal size of a sprite can be modified every time a destination scan line of 
that sprite is processed. This includes scan line processing while the actual sprite is 
off screen. The modification consists of adding the 16 bit stretch value ('STRETCH') 
to the 16 bit size value ('HSIZE') at the end of the processing of a scan line. If the 
stretch value was 0, no effective modification occurs. This moditication only takes 
place if enabled by the rehad bits in SPRCTL1. Since the STRETCH 16 bit value 
consists of 8 bits of size and 8 bits of fraction, the stretch increment can be as small 
as 1/256 of a unit size and as large as 128 unit sizes. A STRETCH value of >128 unit 
sizes wiil cause a wrap in the ALU and result in a size reduction. 
<P><LI>Vertical Stretch<BR> 
The vertical size of a sprite can be modified every time a destination scan line of that 
sprite is processed. The specifics are the same as those for horizontal stretching. 
The value used is also the same as that used for horizontal stretching. Vertical stretch 
can be independently enabled or disabled. Even though the stretch factor is added at 
each destination line processing, the new vertical size only takes effect at the next 
source line fetch. 
<P><LI>T i I t <BR>
The horizontal position of a sprite will be modified every time a scan line of that sprite 
is processed. This includes scan line processing while the actual sprite is off screen. 
The modification consists of 2 steps. The first is to get the 8 bit integer tilt value by 
adding the 16 bit tilt value ('TILT') to the tilt accumulator ('TILTACUM') at the end of the 
processing of a scan line, and shifting the answer to put the upper 8 bits in the lower 
position. The second is to add that integer to the horizontal position of the sprite 
('HPOSSTRT'). This modification only takes place if enabled by the reload bits in 
SPRCTL1. The increments and negativeness are the same as for the stretch bit. 
Positive values of tilt will cause a tilt to the right. If the sprite is painting to the left (either 
due to flip or quadrant), then the software will have to set a negative tilt value if left tilt is 
desired. 
<P><LI>Skip Sprite<BR>
The processing of a particular sprite can be mostty skipped. The only activity that will 
occur is the reading of the first 5 bytes of the SCB. It is required that those 5 bytes be 
legitimate, they will be loaded into the hardware. Note that the last 2 by1es are the 
address of the next SCB. 
<P><LI>Horizontal and Vertical Size Offset <BR>
In order to balance the visual 'bump' that occurs at the reference point of a multi-
quadrant sized sprite, we implemented a 'cheat' value of initial offset for both 
horizontal and vertical size. They are programmed independently at the time of sprite 
engine initialization. For horizontal, the left direction offset is forced to zero, and the 
right direction offset is programmed to 007F. For vertical, the up direction offset is 
forced to zero, and the down direction offset is programmed to 007F.
<P>
When using specific sizes to achieve specific effects, these offsets must be taken into 
account. You may also program them to any 16 bit value you desire. They are 
common to all sprites, so remember to set them back if you want the usual offset 
correction.
</OL>
<P>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME = "_63"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<U><LI>Collision Description</U><BR> 
</A></A>
Sprites have a 4 bit collision number associated with them. The range of this collision 
value is 0->15. This number is the lower 4 bits of the 3rd byte in the SCB, 'SPRCOLL'. 
One of the upper 4 bits is used by the hardware to disable collision activity for this 
sprite. The other 3 are currently ignored by the hardware, but ought to be set to '0' for 
future compatibility. The software must assign this collision number for each use of 
each sprite. The rules for assignment are discussed in a software document.
<P>
There is a collision buffer that is topographically identical to the video buffer. The 
number in each 'cell' of the collision buffer is the collision number of the sprite whose 
video pixel is in the corresponding 'cell' of the video buffer. A value of '0' means that 
there is no collideable object in this pixel (although there may be a visible image). Any 
other number is the collision number ot the last object that was painted into that pixel. 
This buffer is written to by the sprite painting process. All hardware collision detection 
is done with the data in the collision buffer, not the data in the video buffer. This has 
obvious advantages and will be explained at seminars and in newsletters forever.
<P>
 At the completion of the processing of each collideable sprite, the hardware writes a 
byte into the 'collision depository' of that sprites SCB. The contents of that byte are the 
result of the collision process described below. After all of the sprites are painted, 
each of them will have a relevant number in their collision depository. These numbers 
can later be read by the CPU for sprite collision detection.
<P>
In addition, the software can either do its own collision detection, or use the contents 
of the collision buffer for some weird collision detection algorithm. In either event, l will 
be mortally offended.
<OL> 
<P><LI>Collision Process <BR>
During sprite painting to the video buffer, a collision process also takes place. Note 
that the collision process does NOT occur when the CPU directly accesses the video 
buffer. The collision process is also disabled by the appropriate selection of 'sprite 
type' or the setting of any of the other collision disable bits. If the sprite is 'collideable', 
the hardware will write to the collision depository each time the sprite is painted, 
relieving the software from having to clear the byte after collision detection. If the sprite 
is not 'collideable', the hardware will not write to the collision depository, and the 
software may wish to initialize the byte to a 'safe' value. 'Everon' also causes writing to 
the collision depository.
<P>
 At the start of painting a particular sprite, a hardware register called fred is cleared to 
0. In the course of painting this particular sprite, as each pixel is painted, the 
corresponding 'cell' in the collision buffer is read (actually done in bursts of 8 pixels). If 
the number read from the collision buffer cell is larger than the number currently in 
fred, then this larger number will be stored in fred. At the end of the processing of this 
particular sprite, the number in fred will be written out to the collision depository. If 
more than one collideabte object was hit, the number in fred will be the HIGHEST of all 
of the collision numbers detected.
<P>
 If a particular sprites collision depository value is zero, then this particular sprite did 
not collide with any other collideable object while it was being painted to the video 
buffer. This does not mean that this sprite will not be in collision with some other 
object that is painted later, or that it is not in visual collision with any object, it only 
means that the collideable pixels of this sprite did not overlay any collideable pixels 
ALREADY in the collision buffer. If, later on, a sprite is painted that collides with this 
sprite, then that later sprite will register the collision. 
<P>
If a particular sprites collision depository value is non-zero, then this particular sprite 
collided with a collideable object that ALREADY existed in the collision buffer. The 
number found in the collision depository is the collision number of the object that was 
hit. It is hoped that ihe software will assign collision numbers in a meaningful fashion. 
My guess at a meaningful assignment is that the numbers will be assigned in visual 
depth order so that hardware detected collisions will be representative of visually 
noticed collisions. 
<P><LI>Anti-Collision Devices <BR>
In response to popular demand, hardware collision is disableable in many ways.

<A NAME = "_64"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<U><LI>Sprite Data Structure</U><BR> 
</A></A>
Sprite data consists ot a sprite control block (SCB) and a sprite data block. The SCBs 
are linked by pointers in 'Painters Order'. Each SCB also points to the sprite data 
block containing the image of interest. Many SCBs may point to one sprite data block. 
Each occurrence of a sprite on the screen requires 1 SCB. Since all of the SCBs and 
sprite data blocks are accessed by pointers, they may be located anywhere in RAM 
space. Neither SCBs nor sprite data may be located in Mikey ROM. 
<OL>
<P><LI>Sprite Control Block<BR> 
Each SCB contains certain elements in a certain order as required by the hardware. In 
addition, elements may be added by the software as desired. The hardware will not be 
aware of, nor be affected by, these additional elements. 
This list shows the identification and order ot the required elements and some 
possible additional elements.

</PRE>
<P>
The 8 bytes of pen palette are treated by the hardware as a separate block of data 
from the previous group of bytes in the SCB. This means that the reloadability of some 
of the previous bytes does not affect the reusability ot the pen palette. In additioo, this 
means that when some of the bytes are not reloaded, the length of the SCB will be 
smaller by the number of bytes not used. If I have said this in a confusing manner, 
then I have. 
<P><LI>Data Packing Format<BR>
All sprite data is formatted. The format consists of offsets and actual image data. The 
image data can be totally packed, a combination of packed and literal, and totally 
literal. The format is shown below:<BR>

Well, I finally found the bug that required a pad byte of 0 at the end of each scan line of 
data. But, It is actually 2 bugs. I have fixed one of them, but the other requires an 
extensive change. Too bad, I am out of time. Therefore: 
<p>
There is a bug in the hardware that requires that the last meaningful bit of the data 
packet at the end of a scan line does not occur in the last bit of a byte (bit 0). This 
means that the data packet creation process must check for this case, and if found, 
must pad this data packet with a byte of all Os. Don't forget to adjust the offset to 
include this pad byte. Since this will only happen in 1/8 of the scan lines, it is not 
enough overhead to force me to try to fix the bug. Sorry. 
<P>
A data Packet header of '00000' is used as an additional detector of the end of the line 
of sprite data. This is normally used as the tiller in the last byte of a line of data, but it 
can be located anywhere in the data line, not just the last byte. Note that this would 
ordinarily decode to a packed packet of 1 pixel. Please use a literal packet of 1 pixel 
when the imagery calls for such an event. In addition, this special header is used 
when a scan line with no pixels is desired. You must use an offset of 2 with a data 
byte of all 0, since an offset of 1 will cause a change of painting direction. 
<P>
oops, may have a bug, more later on the truth of '00000' 
<P>
In a totally literal sprite, there is no pixel count. Source data is converted to pixels until 
it runs out of bytes in that line of sprite data. The odd bits that may be left over at the 
end ot the last byte will be painted. The special data packet of '00000' is not 
recc:.,nized in a totally literal sprite.

In the display buffer, there will be 2 pixels in a byte of data. When painting the data to

first, and therefore on the left side of the line. The completed bytes will be painted in 
ascending order of byte address.

</A></A>
The sprite engine consists of severai 8 bit control registers, a 16 bit wide sprite control 
block register set and ALU, an address manipulator, an 8 byte deep source data FIFO, 
a 12 bit shift register for unpacking the data, a 16 nybble pen index palette, a pixel byte 
builder, an 8 word deep pixel data FlFO, a data merger, and assorted control logic.

 The basic flow is:
 <UL>
 <P><LI> The address manipulator gets the address ot the source data, gets chunks of 4 
bytes for the data FIFO, and appropriately increments the address.
 <P><LI> The unpacker logic pulls data from the FIFO, serializes it in the shift register, and 
forms it into individuai pen index numbers.
 <P><LI> The pen index number is fed to the pen index palette which produces a 4 bit pen 
number,
 <P><LI> The 4 bit pen numbers go to the pixel byte builder where their transparency and 
collideability are noted, they are combined into bytes, and pfaced in the pixel data 
FIFO.
 <P><LI> The pixel data is then merged with existing RAM data in the video buffer (using 
read-modify-write cycles in the RAM) based on transparency and other control bits. 6. 
The collideability data is then used to perform the collision process with the collision 
buffer.

All of the operations are pipe-tined and operate in an interleaved fashion that reduces 
bottlenecks and results in almost the highest system performance possible.

In order to correctly use the sprite engine, 3 things must be done. First, the CPU must 
initialize certain registers within the engine. Second, appropriately formatted sprite 
control blocks (in RAM) must be created, and they must point to correctly formatted 
sprite data blocks. Third, the sprite engine must be started by the GPU. The start bit is 
described in the hardware address appendix. The formats of sprite control blocks and 
sprite data blocks are described in this document. The required initialization is 
described here. A condensed 'cheat-sheet' can be created later.

<A NAME = "_68"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<P><U><LI>Sprite Engine Initialization</U><BR>
</A></A>
Certain registers must be initialized in the sprite engine after power up. It was not done 
in hardware for two reasons. First is that the engine is useful for other tasks besides 
painting sprites; hardware divide, hardware multiply, etc. Second is that it would have 
been too expensive in silicon to perform the initializations on the style of register array 
used.
<p>
The initialization for the purpose of painting sprites is listed below. The order that the 
registers are initialized is not important as long as ALL of them are initialized to a 
legitimate value before the sprite engine is turned on.

All of these values can be changed during the course of operation as long as all of 
them remain legitimate. 
<p>
Initiatization steps for sprite painting: 
<UL>
<LI>Load the appropriate value into the system control register (SPRSYS).
<LI>Write the correct value into (SPRINIT).
<LI>Write the horizontal pixel offset from zero to the left edge of the screen into HOFF. 
<LI>Write the vertical pixel offset from zero to the top edge of the screen into VOFF.
<LI>Write the base address of the collision buffer into COLLBASE.
<LI>Write the value of the offset between the collision depository location in a RAM 
sprite control block and the location of the first byte of a RAM sprite control block into 
COLLOFF.
<LI>Write the magic numbers into (HSIZOFF) and (VSIZOFF).
<LI>Write a '01' to SUZYBUSEN, giving Suzy permission to access the bus. 
</UL>
<P>
When you are ready to start the sprite engine, the following steps are required: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Write the base address of the video build buffer into VlDBASE.
<LI>Write the address of the start of the first RAM sprite control block into SCBNEXT. 
<LI>Write a '01' (or '05') to SPRGO, turning on the sprite engine.
<LI>Write a '00' to SDONEACK, allowing Mikey to respond to sleep commands.
<LI>Put the CPU to sleep, allowing Suzy to actually get the bus. 
</UL>
<P>
Writing a 01 or 05 to SPRGO sets the 'SPRlTESEN' flip flop which causes the sprite 
engine to start its operation. When the engine finishes processing the sprite list, or if it 
has been requested to stop at the end of the current sprite, or if it has been forced off 
by writing a 00 to SPRGO, the SPRlTESEN flip flop will be reset. This engine starts 
only from its beginning. It can not be stopped and 
restarted from its stopped point. Stopping the engine does not affect the contents of 
any of the other registers. 
<P>
SUZYBUSEN contains the bit that allows Suzys access to the bus. It does not affect 
the internal operation of the sprite engine until such time that the sprite engine needs 
the RAM bus. Then the engine will wait until it gets the bus before continuing its 
processing. It is suspected that in ordinary sprite engine use, this bit will be set once 
and then left on. This bit can be used to pause the sprite engine. The 'unsafe' condition 
of the internal registers is not directly affected by this bit.
<P>
I need to think about how to use it.
