<LI>Hardware Multiply, Accumulate and Divide</A></A>
<P>
We have a 16 by 16 to 32 unsigned and signed multiply with accumulate and a 32 / 16 
into 32 unsigned divide. The results of a multiply are a 32 bit product, a 32 bit 
accumulate and an accumulator overflow bit. The results of a divide are a 32 bit 
dividend, a 16 bit remainder, and a flag bit indicating a divide by zero. The number in 
the dividend as a result of a divide by zero is 'FFFFFFFF (BigNum). The accumulator 
is 32 bits and accumulates the result of multiply operations.<BR>
 The basic method of performing one of these math operations is to write the starting 
values into Suzy registers (all of the addresses are different) and then polling for 
completion prior to reading the results. The act of writing to the last register starts the 
math process.<BR>
 The functions of 'sign/unsign' and 'accumvlate' are optional. The value for SPRINIT is 
currently unchanged for the multiply and divide operations. The following picture 
shows the operations available. 
<P>
Each letter represents a different byte address. These addresses are identified in the 
hardware address Appx 2. Each grouping represents the kind of math operation 
available.

</pre>
<P>
Some Rules:
<P>
 Writing to B,D,F,H,K, or M will force a '0' to be written to A,C,E,G,J, or L, respectfully. 
Therefore, if you only have 8 bits in a particular number, there is no need to write the 
upper byte to '0'. (except for signed multiplies)<BR>
 Writing to A will start a 16 bit multiply.<BR>
 Writing to E will start 8 16 bit divide. 
<p>
The actual steps required to perform some of the functions are: 
<p>
16 x 16 multiply:<BR>
 Write LSB to D, MSB to C<BR>
 Write LSB to B, MS8 to A<BR>
 Poll MULTSTAT until done (or just wait for 54 ticks)<BR>
 Read answer (LSB->MSB) from H,G,F,E 
<p>
Accumulate:<BR>
 To initialize the accumulator, write a '0' to K and M (This will put 0 in J and L). The 
write to 'M' wiil clear the accumulator overflow bit. Note that you can actually initialize 
the accumulator to any value by writing to all 4 bytes (J,K,L,M).
<p>
 32 x 16 divide:<BR>
 Write LSB to P, MSB to N,<BR>
 Write LSB -> MSB to H,G,F,E<BR>
 Poll DIVSTAT until done (or just wait 400 ticks max)<BR> 
 Read answer (LSB->MSB) from D,C,B,A<BR>
Read remainder (LSB->MSB) from M,L
<p>
 As a courtesy, the hardware will set J,K to zero so that the software can treat the 
remainder as a 32 bit number. 
<OL>

<P><LI>Signed Multiplies <BR>
When signed multiply is enabled, the hardware will convert the number provided by 
the CPU into a positive number and save the sign of the original number. The resultant 
positive number is placed in the same Suzy location as the original number and 
therefore the original number is lost. At the end of a multiply, the signs of the original 
numbers are examined and if required, the multiply resvlt is converted to a negative 
number.<BR>
 The conversion that is performed on the CPU provided starting ngmbers is done 
when the upper byte is sent by the CPU. Therefore, while writing to th'e lower byte will 
set the upper byte to zero, it WILL NOT change its sign to positive. Therefore, when 
using signed multiply, you MUST write both bytes of a number. 
<P>
<LI>Repetitive Multiplies and Divides <BR>
Since none of the input values are disturbed, repetitive multiplies and divides are easily 
done by only changing the reqvired bytes and the 'starting' byte. 
<P>
There are several restrictions in the utilization of hardware multiply and divide:
<UL>
<LI>Suzy is not processing sprites.
<LI>The steps to perform the function must be performed exactly as specified. Failure 
to do so will result in botched data.
<LI>The hardware is not re-entrant. This means that once started, a multiply or divide 
can not be messed with. 
</UL>
<P>
There is ap interrupt consideration. Although the hardware is not re-entrant, some 
clever interrupt routine may wish to wait for an operation to complete, save the 
answer, perform its own operation, get its own answer, and then restore the previous 
values. While this works for the simple singular operation, it will disturb the input 
values which may still be required by the original software that is performing repetitive 
operations. If the interrupt software wants to save and restore the original input values, 
it will start a new math operation when it writes them back to the hardware. The 
various implications of this act have not yei been explored, so be cautious. 
<P>
<LI>Math Timing<BR> 
Multiplies with out sign or accumulate take 44 ticks to complete.<BR>
 Multiplies with sign and accumulate take 54 ticks to complete. 
<P>
Divides take 176 + 14*N ticks where N is the number of most significant zeros in the 
divisor.
<P> 
<LI>Bugs in MathLand<BR>
<B>BIG NOTE</B>: There are several bugs in the multiply and divide hardware. Lets hope that 
we do not get a chance to fix them.
<UL>
<LI>In signed multiply, the hardware thinks that 8000 is a positive number.
<LI>In divide, the remainder will have 2 possible errors, depending on its actual value. 
No point in explaining the errors here, just don't use it. Thank You VTI.
<LI>In signed multiply, the hardware thinks that 0 is a negative number. This is not an 
immediate problem for a multiply by zero, since the answer will be re-negated to the 
correct polarity of zero. However, since it will set the sign ftag, you can not depend on 
the sign flag to be correct if you just load the lower byte after a multiply by zero.
<LI>The overflow bit is not permanently saved in the hardware. You must read the 
overflow bit before doing anything to Suzy that might disturb it. Basically, read the 
overflow bit before you access the SCB registers. 
</UL>
</OL>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><A NAME = "_01"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<LI>Upward Compatibility</A></A>
<P>
 Hardware changes can be desired for many reasons. We will probably not implement 
desired hardware changes for many other reasons. However, we may introduce 
product upgrades for which software compatibility is important.<BR>
 To support the upgrades, a read only hardware identifier register and a write only 
software identifier register in both Mikey and Suzy (4 registers total) will be provided. 
These registers will have 'bit' significance in that the individual bits will have individual 
revision or capability significance.<BR>
 In the first Mikey and Suzy, the hardware identifier value will be '01'. The software 
identifier register will not actually exist, only its address is allocated. <BR>
<P>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME = "_02"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<LI>Parallel Port </A></A>
<P>
Some of the prototypes will have a parallel port for debug purposes. The port uses 2 
addresses, one for status and one for data. Both are readlwrite. See the address 
appendix for the details. Basically, you write to the status address to set the port for 
either input or output, and to wiggle the 'Paper Out' pin. You read the status port to see 
if the port has data available, is ready for data, or read a the 'Busy' pin. The hardware 
handshake timing on the parallel port itself is totally handled in hardware. 
Of special note is that changing the direction of the data port will clear the data 
available bit.<BR>
Additionally, the 'SEL' line in the parallel cable is connected to the NMI/ line of the CPU. 
Pulling it low will cause an NMI to happen in the handy CPU. Don't forget to set it high 
again before the handy CPU finishes the NMI software routine. If you are wiggling it 
from an Amiga, you can pull it high as soon as you want to. The Amiga hardware will 
not let its duration be too short. 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><A NAME = "_03"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<LI>Qbert Root</A></A>
<P>
As a compromise between the square root and qube root desires of the software 
people, and the schedule desires of the management, we have decided to incorporate 
the function of QbertRoot. The required steps are:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI>Start a 16 by 16 multiply. 
 <LI>Immediately write to 'E' which will try to start a divide.
 <LI>Read the result from "D,C,B,A'. 
</UL>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><A NAME = "_04"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<LI>Everon </A></A>
<P>
At a particular point in the life of a sprite, it may move in such a manner that it no 
longer appears on the screen. It may also have started its life off-screen. It appears to 
be useful to the software to know that a sprite is completely off-screen. The function 
used to discover this truth is called 'Everon' and is enabled by the 'Everonoff' bit. The 
function is enabled when the Sprite 8ngine is started with an 05 instead of an 01 at 
'SPRGO'. This function will cause the 'Everon' bit to reflect the off- screen situation of 
a particular sprite. This bit is returned to each SCB in bit 7 of the collision depository. 
The bit will be a '0' if Everon is disabled or if the sprite is ever on the screen. The bit is 
a '1' only when Everon is enabled (Everonoff-is on) and the sprite is neveron the 
screen. 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><A NAME = "_05"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<LI>Unsafe Access </A></A>
<P>
As expressed earlier in this document, there are limes when certain addresses are 
unsafe to access. If, by some unknown means, the software does an unsafe access, 
the unsafe access bit in SPRSYS will be set. This bit will remain set until it is cleared 
as expiained in the hardware address appendix.
<P>
<B>BIG NOTE</B>: Unsafe access is broken for math operations. Please reset it after every 
math operation or it will not be useful for sprite operations.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><A NAME = "_06"><A HREF = "#TOP"><LI>Howie Notification</A></A>
<P>
For purposes of diagnostics, there is a Suzy address that is used to notify the Howard 
board of a desired communication. See the hardware address spec. 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><A NAME = "_07"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<LI>General I/O Port</A></A>
<P> 
In the beginning, there was a general purpose 8 bit I/O port. As pins on Mikey became 
unavailable, the number of bits was reduced. Now all we have are the 5 bits of lODAT 
and they are not even pure read/write.<BR>
 The direction of the pins (in or out) still needs to be set even though all but one are 
forced in the PCB to be either an in or an out but not both. The function of the bits are 
not apparent from the description in the address appendix, so I will explain them here.
<UL> 
<LI> External Power.<BR>
 This bit detects the presence of a powered plug. The ROM sets it to an output, so the 
system code must set it to an input. 
<P><LI>Cart Address Data.<BR>
 This bit must be set to an output. It has 2 functions. One is that it is the data pin for 
the shifter that holds the cartridge address. The other is that it controls power to the 
cartridge.. Power is on when the bit is low, power is off when the bit is high. 
<P><LI>Noexp.<BR>
 This bit must be set to an input. It detects the presence of a plug in the expansion 
connector. 
<P><LI>Rest.<BR>
 This bit must be set to an output. ln addition, the data value of this bit must be set to 
1. This bit controls the rest period of the LCD display. The actual Rest signal is a high 
except during the last 2 scan lines of vertical blank and the first scan line after vertical 
blank. It is generated by the vertical timing chain in Mikey but its output on this pin can 
be disabled by the incorrect setting of this bit. In addition, when reading this bit, you will 
get the actual state of the Rest signal 'anded' with the value of the bit set in lODAT. 
Yes, we know that the polarity of the name is wrong, but that is the way it came to us. 
<P><LI>Audin.<BR>
 This bit can be an input or an output. In its current use, it is the write enable line for 
writeable elements in the cartridge. It can also be used as an input from the cartridge 
such as 'audio in' for 'talking-listening' games. Whether it is set to input or output, the 
value read on this pin will depend on the electronics in the cartridge that is driving it. 
<P><LI>The other bits.<BR>
 The other 3 bits in the byte are not connected to anything specific. Don't depend on 
them being any particuiar value.

The expansion connector is a 3 wire stereo earphone jack. The pin assignments are: 
<P>
 Shield: Ground<BR>
 Tip: VCC<BR>
 Center: Data <BR>
<P>
There are certain considerations for data transfer, more later.
