<P>
<P>
 The state of all of the control bits during and immediately after system reset is given 
in appendix 2. During reset, the main clocks are still running and are used to 
propagate the reset condition thru the logic. Reset must be long enough to insure a 
stable and consistent startup.<BR>
 The process that takes place upon release from system reset and the steps required 
to initialize the hardware are described below. 
<OL>
<P><A NAME = "_00"><A HREF = "#TOP"><LI>Suzy Reset Recovery.</A>
<P> 
At release from reset, all of Suzy is disabled and remains so until enabled by the CPU. 
During reset, the bus handshake logic has stabilized with bus grant asserted. Any 
incidental internal activity wili be listed when the logic design is completed. Suzy is not 
expected to require any software initialization until a specific function of Suzy is 
desired. 

<P><A NAME = "_01"><A HREF = "#TOP"><LI>Mikey Reset Recovery.</A>
<P>>
 At release from system reset, the video bus request is disabled and will remain so 
until enabled by the CPU. The CPU is requesting the bus. During reset, the bus 
handshake logic has stabilized and is ready to give the bus to the CPU. The ROM 
overlay is enabled and the CPU will fetch its reset vector from ROM at the normal 
6502 address of FFFC and FFFD.<BR>
 Since there are some pieces of hardware that are running at rates siower than the 
main system ctock, there is the possibility that there will not be a deterministic 
relationship between the phases of these slower clocks (eg. CPU and audio/timer). To 
prevent possibte peculiarities of operation (due to hardware bugs) and to assist in 
truthful software emulation, it is suggested that these individual hardware chunks get 
synchronized at system start. It may be expensive to do it all in silicon, so some of 
them may need to be done by software. At this time, Glenn says that the audio section 
is done in silicon. There are other hardware registers that must be initialized correctly 
in order to let the system come up consistently. They are stated in appendix 2 
(hardware addresses). 
<P>
The current process that must be followed at system initialization is:<BR>
 1. Disable interrupts<BR>
 2. Clear decimal mode<BR>
 3. Read SUZYHREV<BR>
 4. If =0, jump to test code<BR>
 5. Read 8 locations in RAM (each must cause a new RAS to occur)<BR>

 <H1 ALIGN=CENTER><U> 15. Definitions and Terminology</U></H1>
<P></A>
 The polarity of signals and their effect on the circuitry is not always apparent from the 
name of the signals. For this document and its related documents and appendices, 
the following conventions will be used: 
<P>
Set = On = Asserted = Active = Occurs<BR>
 These mean that the signal is in the state that causes or allows its named function to 
occur. For example, if bus grant is set, we are granting a bus. If an interrupt mask bit 
is set, that interrupt is masked. 
<P>
Reset = Off = Cleared = De-asserted = Inactive = Dropped<BR>
 These mean that the signal is in the state that does not allow its named function to 
occur. For example, when bus request is dropped, we are no longer requesting the 
bus. 
<P>
The terms 'hi' and 'low' are well applied to actual schematic referenced signals, but 
should be avoided in generally descriptive text. 
<P>
Acquired = Taken<BR>
 These relate to tri-state busses and indicate that the bus is now being driven by the 
'acquirer'. 
<P>
Released = Let Go<BR>
 These also relate to tri-state busses and indicate that the 'releaser' is no longer 
driving the bus. 
<P>
SimWait = Boil<BR>

 <H1 ALIGN=CENTER><U>17. Approved Exemptions </U></H1>
<P></A>
<OL>
<LI>Only the upper byte of the 'NEXT' word in the SCB needs to be set to zero in order 
to indicate that this is the last SCB in the list. The lower byte of that word can then be 
used for any other function since the hardware will ignore it if the upper byte is zero. 
<P>
<LI>Some of the sprite values (H size, V size, etc) are re-usable. The normal way to 
reuse them is to have the first sprite in the local list actually initialize the values, and 
then have the remaining sprites in the local list re-use them. One of the difficulties in 
doing it this way is that it is not always reasonable to arrange the list and the SCABs 
appropriately. One of the ways to simplify the problem is to use an initializing sprite 
with the desired numbers in the reusable registers.<BR>
 I have been asked to provide an exemption that would allow the software to write 
directly to the hardware registers in the Suzy SCB and thus avoid all of the overhead 
of arranging the lists or creating null sprites. Since this section of hardware is firmly 
tied to the sprite software process, I believe that it will be OK to write directly to the 
hardware registers. I could be wrong, so I am going to approve the following 
conditional exemption.<BR>
 It will be OK to write to the twentyfour 16 bit registers of the Suzy SCB PROVIDING 
that you only do it via the MACRO PROVlDED TO YOU BY RJ MICAL In addition, you 
must understand that the contents of this macro may change if future revisions of the 
hardware so require. In addition, you must understand that future hardware may make 
the process not work and therefore the macro will be changed to be a warning that 
you can't use it anymore.<BR>
 Don't cheat.

 <H1 ALIGN=CENTER><U>18.Common Errors </U></H1>
<P></A>
There are errors that many first time programmers and some experienced 
programmers make with this hardware. Some of these errors may be difficult tO 
identify due to the complexity of the ICs. I will list some of them here to aid in the 
debugging of 'Mystery Bugs'.
<P>
<OL>
<li>The presence of an interrupt in Mikey, regardless of the state of the CPU enable 
interrupt bit, will prevent the CPU from going to sleep, and thus prevent Suzy from 
functioning. So if sprites stop working, unintentional interrupt bits can be the hidden 
cause. 
<p>
<LI>The Suzy Done Acknowledge address must be written to prior to running the sprite 
engine. This is required even prior to the first time the sprite engine is activated. It it is 
not written to in the appropriate sequences, the GPU will not go to 
sleep when so requested. In addition, if some software accidentally allows a Suzy 
operation to complete without then following that completion with a write to 
SDONEACK, the CPU will not sleep. So if sprites stop working, something may have 
gone wrong with your SDONEACK software. 
<P>
<LI>Writes to the cartridge are blind. If you accidentally access Suzy before the required 
delay period, you will modify some internal bus in Suzy. The results are not definable.
