Handy is a portable hand held programmable video game. It is totally self contained 
with its own power source, display screen, fluorescent backlight speaker, and data 
input reader.

<U><LI>Marketing Feature Set</U></A></A>
<P>
The unit is portable, allowing its use in many areas previously untouched by arcade  
games. The unit is programmable thru the use of small data cartridges. The unit can 
be privately used with earphones. The marketing advantages are obvious. They can 
be detailed in a marketing document. Certain advantages, however, are worth 
mentioning here.  
<P>
In addition to using the game in the usual <I>play</I> areas, the player can easily carry the  
game and several of the compact data cartridges to nearly any <I>play</I> location. For  
example, long car rides, airplane flights, sales meetings, and visits to relatives. With  
the use of an earphone, the game can be played without audible disturbance of the  
other car passengers, relatives, or classmates.
<P>
By adding the expansion module (an infra-red communications pod ), many players  
may play simultaneously and interactively in a common game (car race, space battle,  
snow ball fight, etc.) Additionally, a matching receiver unit could plug into the joystick  
connector of a C64 or other game machine and Handy could be used as a wireless  
joystick. 
<P>
Intergame communications can also be done with a wire. Many players can be 
connected in parallel on the same wire.
