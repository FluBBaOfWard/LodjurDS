<p>
The CPU is a 65C02 cell imbedded in the Mikey IC. The specifics of its instruction set 
and register operations are found in the VT1 specification. 
<P>
<OL><A NAME ="_00"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<U><LI>CPU Cycle Timing</U></A></A><BR>
While the number of CPU cycles for each instruction are defined in the VTI spec, the 
number of system 'ticks' used by each CPU cycle are defined here. Some cycles will 
require a fixed nuraber of ticks, some will require a variable number of ticks based on 
the instructiori that preceded it, and some will require a variable (and sometimes non-
deterministic) number of ticks based on the functioning of other pieces of hardware in 
the system. In addition, the CPU can be paused by the video and refresh accesses, 
and it can be interrupted by the timers and the serial port. The point of listing all of 
these variances to the GPU timing numbers is to advise the programmer that CPU 
cycles can not be used as the timing elements in small software timers. Under certain 
specific circumstances, the environment will be sufficiently controlled to allow for 
small software timers (initial mag tape reading), but in general, that practice should be 
avoided. 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>RAM Page Mode<BR>
The RAMs used in the system have a page mode operation in which one of the control 
signals (RAS) is not repeated for each memory access. This allows the cycle to be 
shorter than a normal access cycle. The reqvirement for using a page mode cycle is 
that the current access is in the same 256 address page of memory as the previous 
access. While comparing cvrrent and previous addresses is certainly a valid method 
of determining if a page mode cycle can be used, it usually takes the same or more 
time than just repeating the control signal. As a result, page mode is often not used by 
many CPU designers.
<P>
We use the method of decoding the current op-code to see if the next cycle could be a 
page mode cycle and then observing the other pertinent states of the system to see if 
some reason exists to NOT allow a page mode cycle. While this method is not 100% 
etficient in allowing all possible page mode opportunities, its silicon requirements are 
small and when properly designed it does not permit false page mode cycles.
The CPU makes use of the page mode circuitry in its op-code reads. All writes and all 
data reads are done in normal memory cycles. A page mode op-code read takes 4 
ticks, a normal read or write to RAM takes 5 ticks. 
<P>
<LI>Hardware Accesses, DTACK<BR>
CPU accesses to hardware require an acknowledge signal (DTACK) from that 
hardware in order for the CPU cycle to proceed. These CPU accesses fall into 2 
classes. One is for hardware that is always available and the other is for hardware 
that becomes available at a time not related to the CPU.
<P>
For always available hardware, the DTACK can be generated from the address 
decode and not cause the cycle to be longer than a RAM read or write cycle (5 ticks). 
Writes to Suzy are handled as 'always available' whether or not Suzy is actually 
available. 
<P>
For eventually available hardware, (some of Suzy and some of Mikey), the DTACK is 
generated as a combination of the address decode, sometimes the column strobe, 
and the particular hardware being accessed. This cycle has a minimum requirement 
of 5 ticks and a maximum requirement of 128 ticks (probable actual maximum of 40). 
The maximum is not related to the CPU, it is required to prevent video and refresh 
underflows. All writes to Suzy are 'Blind' in that the write cycle is always 5 ticks long 
and does not get a DTACK. Suzy will accept the data immediately and then place it 
internally as required. The maximum time required for this internal placement is 6 ticks 
(except for writes to the game cart). This is less than the fastest turnaround time for 2 
sequential writes to Suzy, so no collisions will occur. Poof for unsafe addresses. 
Some of the hardware in Mikey is constructed of Dual Ported RAMs addressed in a 
cyclical manner. These DPRAMs will have a maximum latency equal to their cycle 
time (1.25 us).
<P>
Some of the hardware in Suzy is also constructed of Dual Ported RAMs. These RAMs 
are not cycling, but their latency is still slightly vyriable (+1 tick, -0) due to clock 
synchronization.
<P>
The CPU accessible addresses in both Mikey and Suzy are not all readable and 
writeable. See the hardware address appendix (appx 2) for the specifics.

<LI>CPU NMI Latency<BR>
The NMI signal path from the pin of Mikey to the pin of the internal CPU contains 
clocked delays. This will make the usability of ihe pin questionable in the debug 
environment.
<P>
Fortunately for us, Howard and Craig arranged the diagnostic hardware to still use it 
effectively. See ihe Howard board spec for details. 
<P>
<LI>Suzy Bus Request-Bus Grant Latency<BR>
The maximum a1lowable latency at Suzy is constrained by the needs of the video 
DMA circuit. As a compromise between bigger FlFOs in the Mikey video DMA and 
reduced performance in Suzy, we are setting the maximum latency from Bus Request 
to Bus Grant at 2.5 us. 
<p>
The time between Mikey requesting the bus and Suzy releasing it is dependant on the 
state of the currently running process inside of Suzy. The longest process is 30 ticks. 
Adding the overhead of accepting the bus request and releasing the bus grant brings 
the total to 40 ticks. 
</OL>
<P><A NAME ="_01"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<U><LI>ROM</U></A></A><BR>
The system ROM is imbedded in Mikey. Its size is 512 bytes. Its main and perhaps 
only function is to read in the initial data from the data input system and then execute 
that data. In the case of the magnetic tape system, some error correction will be 
performed. 
<P><A NAME ="_02"><A HREF = "#TOP">
<U><LI>CPU Sleep</U></A></A><BR>
<B>BIG NOTE</B>: Sleep is broken in Mikey. The CPU will NOT remain asleep unless Suzy is 
using the bus. There is no point in putting the GPU to sleep unless you expect Suzy to 
take the bus. We will figure out how to save power some other way.
<P>
I will still keep the foilowing paragraphs pertaining to sleep in this spec.
<P>
The CPU can put itself to sleep by writing to the CPU disable address. The CPU 
wants to sleep for two reasons. The first is that it is done with all of its work and we 
would like to conserve battery power. In this case, the CPU would pre-arrange for an 
interrupt to wake it up at the next time that work needs to be done (probably vertical 
restart). When awoken by an interrupt, normal interrupt vectoring takes place. Note 
that if no interrupt occurs, the CPU sleeps forever. An interrupt will wake you up even if 
they are disabled inside the CPU. The second reason to sleep is that Suzy has been 
requested (by the CPU) to do work. In that case, it is up to Suzy to awaken the CPU 
when it is done. When awoken by Suzy, processing continues from where it left off.
The CPU cannot fall asleep unless it puts on its pajamas. This is accomplished by 
disabling all interrupts (register in Mikey) that you do not want to wake you up, then 
clearing them (in case they came in while you were disabling them), and then writing 
to the Suzy Wakeup Acknowledge address IF you were woken up by Suzy (or if this is 
the first time you are going to steep). The purpose of the Suzy Wakeup Acknowledge 
address is to prevent missing the wakeup request from Suzy should it occur exactly at 
the same time as an interrupt.
