<U><LI>Frame Rate</U></A></A><BR>
We have a programmable frame rate to accommodate either 50 or 60 Hz lighting 
systems. We may also want to vary the frame rate for 'game' reasons.
While no vertical blanking is actvally required by the LCD, the system likes to have 
some non-disptay time in which to cleanly change the display characteristics. In 
addition, multipte player games need some dead time between frames to re- 
synchronize to the master. Since reloading the color palette could take 150 us, at least 
1 and perhaps 2 scan lines of time should be allocated as vertical blank time. The 
current method of driving the LCD requires 3 scan lines of vertical blank. 
<P>
During vertical blank time, none of the display lines are allowed to be on. If they were, 
that line would be noticeably 'brighter' than the others.
Additionally, the magic 'P' counter has to be set to match the LCD scan rate. The 
formula is:<BR>
INT((((line time - .5us) / 15) * 4) -1) 
<P>
Don't forget to set the display control bits. Normal 4 bit color is:<BR>
 'DISPCTL' (FD92) = x'0D'
<P>
Some frame rate choices are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>60Hz:<BR>
 159 us x 105 lines 16.695 ms (59.90 Hz], 3 lines of Vertical Blank<BR>
 For normal 60Hz video operation, set the relevant timers as follows:<BR>
 Timer 0: clock=1us, backup=158.<BR>
 FD00=x'9E', FD01 x'18'<BR>
 Timer 2: clock=linking, backup=104.<BR>
 FD08=x'68', FD09=x'1F'<BR>
 Pcount: 'PBKUP' = 41.<BR>
 FD93= x'29'<BR>
<P>
<LI>50Hz:<BR>
 190 us x 105 lines =19.950 ms [50.13 Hz), 3 lines of Vertical Blank.<BR>
 For 50Hz video operation, set the relevant timers as follows:<BR>

 Timer 0: clock=1 us, backup=189.<BR>
 FD00=x'BD', FD01=x'18'<BR>
 Timer 2: clock=linking, backup=104.<BR>
 FD08=x'68', FD09=x'1F'<BR>
 Pcount: 'PBKUP' = 49.<BR>
 FD93= x'31'<BR>
<P>
<LI>75Hz:<BR>
 127 us x 105 lines =13.335 ms [74.99 Hz], 3 lines of Vertical Blank<BR>
 For 75Hz video operation, set the relevant timers as follows:<BR>

 Timer 0: clock=1us, backup=126.<BR>
 FD00= x'7E', FD01 = x'18'<BR>
 Timer 2: clock=linking, backup=104.<BR>
 FD08=x'68', FD09=x'1F'<BR>
 Pcount: 'PBKUP' = 32.<BR>
 FD93= x'20'<BR>
</OL>
<P>
The maximum frame rate occurs when Hcount is 121 (backup = 120) which resutts in 
a vertical frequency of 78.7 Hz. 75 Hz (a useful rate) is achieved by setting the H 
backup value to 126 (x'7E'). The vertical values do not change. 
<P>
We notice that 50Hz operation causes a massive flicker that is probably due to the 
speed of the LCD itself. 50 Hz may not be usable.

<U><LI>Pen Numbers/Color Palette</U></A></A><BR> 
The display system has 4 bits of pen number per pixel in each display buffer. The 
color value of a particular pixel is converted from its pen number by the color palette in 
Mikey. There is only one color palette in the system. The color palette can be written to 
at any time (it is 'always available hardware'). The color display has rectangular 
shaped pixels (resulting in square triads) arranged in the following grid.

<LI>Flipped Color Palette<BR>
When the screen is flipped, the data is read from RAM starting at the bottom of the 
screen. This means that any screen related color palette changing must take 'flip' into 
account and reverse its order accordingly. 
<P>
<LI>Monochrome Disptay<BR>
A long time ago, in a galaxy far away, monochrome display was considered. The 
chips still have some monochrome logic in them, and certain bits still need to be set in 
order to iosure color operation. I have removed ail non-pertinent monochrome 
information from the specifications. Please let me know if I missed any.

<U><LI>Display World/Suzy Painting Buffer/Mikey Display Buffer</U></A></A><BR> 
The display world is an imaginary 64K pixel by 64K line space. Sprites may be 
positioned anywhere within the world by use of their 16 bit horizontal and 16 bit vertical 
positions. The origin of this world (0H, 0V) is the upper left corner.
<P>
 The 160 pixel by 102 line Suzy painting buffer can be positioned anywhere in that 
world by setting a horizontal and vertical offset. The numbers sent to the Suzy 
hardware will be the distance from the upper left corner of the display world to the 
upper left corner of the Suzy painting buffer. Portions of sprites outside the Suzy 
painting buffer will be 'clipped' by the hardware and therefore not drawn into any RAM. 
Since the offset numbers are used in the placement of a sprite in real RAM, changing 
the numbers will affect previously drawn sprites differently from sprites yet to be 
drawn. Any sprites drawn prior to a change in the offset numbers will remain unmoved 
in the Suzy painting buffer. Any sprites drawn after the change in the offset numbers 
will be positioned in accordance with those new numbers.
<P>
The Mikey Display buffer is the 8160 byte (102 lines x 80 bytes) area of RAM that is 
displayed on the LCD. 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Display Buffer Address Register<BR>
The software can elect to have any number of dispiay buffers. Two will allow for 
normal double buffering of the screen.
<P>
The value in the register is the start (upper left corner) of the display buffer in normal 
mode and the end (lower right corner) of the display buffer in FLIP mode. The address 
of the upper left corner of any display buffer must have '00' in the bottom 2 bits (only 
the upper 14 bits of the address are used). The hardware registers in Suzy are loaded 
with the start (upper left corner) of the painting or collision buffer, regardless ot FLIP 
mode.
<P>
<LI>Display Buffer Address Register<BR>
The hardware address in Mikey (DISPADDR) is the backup value for the actual 
address counter. The backup value is transferred to the address counter at the very 
start of the third line of vertical blanking. In addition, the actual address register can be 
changed in real time by writing a 1 into the bit 'VBLANKEF' of Mikey register 'MTEST2'.

<U><LI>External Power Plug Detector</U></A></A><BR>
The presence of a plug in the 'external power' jack can be detected by the hardware. 
Whether or not any power is provided by the inserted plug is not actvally discernable, 
since inserting the plug will disconnect the batteries. Therefore, the detection of an 
inserted plug ought to mean that the unit is operating on externally supplied power. 
Please note that this external power might be a large battery pack in addition to being 
an Ac adaptor. The main purpose of providing this information to the software is so 
that it can select the appropriate time-out values for the auto power down modes. 
<P>
Since the I/O pin we are using used to be an autput (backlight control), it is set to 
'output' by the Mikey ROM. While this will not cause any damage to the parts, the pin 
will not function correctly until the software has set it to 'input'.
