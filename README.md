# LodjurDS V0.1.4

<img align="right" width="220" src="./logo.png" alt="The Lynx logo"/>

An Atari Lynx emulator for Nintendo DS(i)/3DS.

## How to use

1. Create a folder named "lodjurds" in either the root of your flash card or in
 the data folder. This is where settings and save files end up.
2. Now put game/bios files into a folder where you have (Lynx) roms, max
 768 games per folder, filenames must not be longer than 127 chars. You can use
 zip-files (as long as they use the deflate compression).
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

Note! You need a bios to be able to run games.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
up the menu.
Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A or double tap
to select an option, B or the top of the screen to go back a step.

To select between the tabs use R & L or the touchscreen.
